# @package _global_

# NOTE: This custom launcher (separate from the built-in 'hydra/launcher' node) is meant to override global options
# that depend on the hardware resources available and for which the default options are for local runs
# (e.g. GPU devices, number of dataloader workers, progress bar display, etc.)

defaults:
  - override /hydra/launcher: alliancecan

# Force the data to be specified using an environment variable, to be able to change its value between
# i) when the jobs are submitted (env var points to data on shared filesystem)
# ii) and when jobs are run (env var points to data on compute node)
paths:
  data_dir: ${oc.env:ASCENT_DATA_PATH}
