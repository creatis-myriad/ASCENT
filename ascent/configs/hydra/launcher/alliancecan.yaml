  # We are forced to specify new required options in the additional parameters instead of at the group level
  # because the config is typed-checked against th submitit plugin's structured configs
  # However, `additional_parameters` is a dict, and therefore does not check if required values are set.
  # It is thus up to us to check it manually using our own validation logic at the start of a run
